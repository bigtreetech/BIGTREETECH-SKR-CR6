# BIGTREETECH-SKR-CR6 - Temperature Reporting Fix

This branch contains a fix for the [erroneous temperature reporting issue](https://community.octoprint.org/t/octoprint-doesnt-show-a-temperature-graph-for-my-creality-printer/23901).

I've included a build of the firmware for the CR6-SE with the original Creality touchscreen - however no warranty, at your own risk etc.
If it causes you trouble, revert to BTT's supplied firmware in the upstream repository.

Also I make no promise to update this as and when BTT fix stuff in their repository. I'm hoping they fix it upstream, at which point I'll delete this branch.
